# flowgraph

event creator for godot games (and other things too, maybe)

uses a graph system to define events, and custom yaml nodepacks to define different actions in an event

I'm trying to make something easily extensible for use in anyone's projects but it is primarily for my own use. Make a bug report if there's a feature you need for a project and i might try to make it, but no promises atp.

dunno why I'm bothering with making a readme, its not like anyone else will ever use this
